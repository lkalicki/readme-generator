# Professional README Generator

## Description 

The Professional README Generator is designed to help generate a README file for projects, based on the information entered by a user. It helps speed up the process of creating one by already having some of the information prepared in the backend so that once the questions are all answered, a README file is created with the provided information and can be utilized right away. The README Generator uses Node.js. 

## Installation

In order to install the README Generator, the user must download the code and then initialize the directory to run Node.js, as well as download the inquirer package. Then, utilizing the Command Prompt, they can run node, reply to the prompts, and generate a README file in the dist folder.

## Usage 

To run the application, enter 'node index.js' in the command prompt and respond to the prompted questions. 

A Walkthrough video of the README Generator is available here.
